# NASA TRMM rainfall data

**TLDR:** I used NASA TRMM rainfall data for my MSc Thesis in Economics exploring the effects of rainfall shocks on child health by gender in rural Ethiopia. My thesis partner, Bj√∂rn, and I had no idea what we were getting into and it ended up serving as a crash course in R.

## Description

Now that I have been developing my coding skills, my goals for this repo are to:

- Refactor the original R code (lots of room for improvement)
- Write documentation to help others tap into the wealth of rainfall data (NASA is the best!)
- Work on a Python version of the code

## Structure

### Docs

The process of using rainfall data can be challenging and has lots of steps, hence this guide (WIP):

- [Guide to using NASA TRMM data](https://github.com/margotkurfess/NASA-TRMM/blob/master/docs/data-process.md)

And if you're interested in what this was all for or to get a little more context into my thesis work:

- [This is my MSc Thesis in a very small nutshell](https://github.com/margotkurfess/NASA-TRMM/blob/master/docs/thesis-overview.md)

### Code

The code will then be broken out by language in the following folders:

- [R](https://github.com/margotkurfess/NASA-TRMM/tree/master/R)
- [Python](https://github.com/margotkurfess/NASA-TRMM/tree/master/Python)

### Data

The raw data will live in the following folder:

- [Data](https://github.com/margotkurfess/NASA-TRMM/tree/master/data)

## Contribution

I would love for this work to be as useful as possible so please feel free to fork the repo or [send me an email](mailto:margot.kurfess@gmail.com) with any suggestions for improvement!
