# NASA TRMM rainfall data

**TLDR:** I used NASA TRMM rainfall data for my MSc Thesis in Economics exploring the effects of rainfall shocks on child health by gender in rural Ethiopia. My thesis partner, Bj√∂rn, and I had no idea what we were getting into and it ended up serving as a crash course in R. Now that I have developed my coding skills, my goals for this repo are to:

- Refactor the original R code (lots of room for improvement)
- Write documentation to help others tap into the wealth of rainfall data (NASA is the best!!)
- Work on a Python version of the code
