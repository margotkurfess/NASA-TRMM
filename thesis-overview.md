This paper seeks to estimate the effects of rainfall fluctuations on the anthropometric
health of children under the age of five in rural Ethiopia. Our interest is to study
whether boys and girls experience differential treatment in the intra-household allocation
of resources towards health following rainfall shocks in the previous rainy season
and whether or not children of different ages are especially sensitive. We investigate
how these deviations in rainfall affect children’s anthropometric measures, as measured
by z-scores for weight-for-height, weight-for-age, and height-for-age. Using survey data
from the Demographic Health Survey and rainfall data from NASA, this paper seeks
to add to the inconclusive literature on investment in children’s health by gender in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia provides a particularly suitable setting for linking rainfall
to income due to its high level of agricultural dependence and households’ low
capabilities for consumption smoothing. We find that children under the age of five
benefit in weight-for-age and height-for-age following a positive rainfall shock, but that
female children fare worse in terms of weight-for-age compared to their male counterparts.
When looking at age cohorts, newborns are found to be especially sensitive
to both wet and dry shocks. While newborn boys benefit in terms of weight-for-age
and height-for-age following a positive shock, newborn girls have significantly worse
outcomes for the same measures in comparison. Newborns are found to benefit in
general from negative rainfall shocks.
